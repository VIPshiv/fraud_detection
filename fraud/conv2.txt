Hi, this is Officer Raj from the Income Tax Department.
He greeted me warmly and asked how I’m doing.
He said that they’ve been trying to contact you for days.
According to him, you owe ₹50,000 in unpaid taxes.
He explained that it’s from a filing error last year.
He warned that ignoring this could lead to arrest.
I asked what we should do, and he replied quickly.
He instructed me to tell you to pay via bank transfer.
He said the account details are ready—here they are.
He added that it’s due by 6 PM today, no exceptions.
He mentioned that legal action is the next step otherwise.
I told him I’d inform you urgently, and he agreed.
He said to call 555-0199 if you’re confused.
He assured me it’s a simple fix if you act now.
He emphasized that this isn’t a scam—just protocol.
I asked if there’s a grace period, but he said no.
He urged me to stress the urgency to you.
He concluded that paying now avoids bigger trouble.
He asked me to confirm once you’ve sent the funds.
Let’s resolve this soon, he pleaded!
