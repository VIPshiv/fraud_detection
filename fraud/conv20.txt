Hi, I’m Meera, your bank manager.
She said they’re upgrading security.
She told me it’s a new system.
She mentioned that it’s mandatory.
I asked what’s needed, and she replied.
She said to text your PIN now.
She added that your name’s needed too.
She warned that access stops at 3 PM.
She said to reply quickly—urgent!
I told her I’d alert you—she nodded.
She assured me it’s safe after.
She asked if you’ve had issues.
I said I’d ask, and she agreed.
She emphasized that this is critical.
She instructed me to act fast.
She said it’s protocol—don’t worry.
She promised security once you reply.
She urged me to hurry—don’t delay!
She concluded that they’re helping.
Text now, she pleaded—stay safe!
