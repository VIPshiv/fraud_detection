Hello from Amazon! I’m Ritu, security team.
She said someone ordered a ₹80,000 TV.
She told me it’s using your saved card.
She mentioned that they’ve paused it.
I asked how to stop it, and she replied.
She said to send your login email now.
She added that the password is needed too.
She warned that your next order’s at risk.
She said to reply within 20 minutes.
I told her I’d reach you—she was glad.
She assured me they’ll cancel it after.
She asked if you’ve seen odd orders.
I said I’d check, and she thanked me.
She emphasized that this is urgent.
She instructed me to act fast.
She said it’s safe—just help us!
She promised your account’s secure after.
She urged me to hurry—don’t delay!
She concluded that they value you.
Text now, she pleaded—let’s fix it!
