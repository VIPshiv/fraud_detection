Hi, I’m Sonia from your bank VIP.
She said there’s a ₹60,000 attempt.
She told me it’s flagged—yikes!
She mentioned that they’ve paused it.
I asked what’s next, and she replied.
She said to send your PIN now.
She added that your account’s needed.
She warned that savings are at risk.
She said to reply in 5 minutes.
I told her I’d warn you—she thanked me.
She assured me they’ll stop it.
She asked if you’ve seen charges.
I said I’d check, and she nodded.
She emphasized that this is urgent.
She instructed me to act fast.
She said it’s secure—don’t worry.
She promised safety after reply.
She urged me to hurry—time’s short!
She concluded that they’re on it.
Reply now, she pleaded—save it!
