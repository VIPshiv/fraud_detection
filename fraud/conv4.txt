Hey there! This is your PayPal security assistant.
She said they’ve spotted a login from Delhi.
She told me it’s not your usual device—odd!
She mentioned that your account is at risk.
I asked what we should do, and she replied fast.
She said to text your email and password here.
She added that card details are needed too.
She warned that your ₹1,00,000 balance is exposed.
She said to reply within 15 minutes—urgent!
I told her I’d get you on this right away.
She assured me they’ll lock it down after.
She asked if you’ve seen any weird charges.
I said I’d ask you, and she appreciated it.
She emphasized that delays could freeze your funds.
She instructed me to push you to act now.
She said this is standard security protocol.
She promised it’ll be safe once you reply.
She concluded that they value your trust.
She urged me to hurry—time’s ticking!
Let’s secure it, she pleaded—text now!
