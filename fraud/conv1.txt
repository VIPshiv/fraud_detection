Hello! This is Priya from your bank’s security team.
I hope you’re doing well today!
She said that there’s been some odd activity on your account.
Apparently, someone tried logging in from Mumbai yesterday.
I assured her we’re handling it, but we need your help.
She mentioned that you should send your PIN to confirm it’s you.
It’s just a quick step, she added, to keep things safe.
Oh, and she also said we’re updating our records.
Could you share your account number too?
She emphasized that it’s urgent—time’s running out!
If we don’t act fast, she warned, your funds could vanish.
I told her I’d reach out to you right away.
She said to reply within 10 minutes to avoid a lockout.
Thanks for helping us, she noted—it’s appreciated!
She asked if you have any questions about this.
I said I’d pass them on if you do.
She insisted this is critical for your safety.
Please hurry, she urged—don’t delay!
She promised we’ll secure everything once you reply.
Let’s keep your money protected, she concluded!
