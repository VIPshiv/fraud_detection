Hi, this is Inspector Leela from Police.
She said your name’s tied to fraud.
She told me it’s a ₹25,000 scam.
She mentioned that they’re investigating.
I asked what’s next, and she replied.
She said to pay ₹25,000 via wire.
She added that your license’s needed.
She warned that a warrant’s next.
She said to act by tomorrow.
I told her I’d warn you—she nodded.
She assured me it’s fixable.
She asked if you’ve shared details.
I said I’d check, and she agreed.
She emphasized that this is serious.
She instructed me to pay fast.
She said it’s official—trust her!
She promised clearance after.
She urged me to hurry—urgent!
She concluded that they’re helping.
Pay now, she insisted—don’t risk!
