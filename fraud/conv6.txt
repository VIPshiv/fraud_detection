Hi, this is Anjali from your credit card company.
She said there’s a ₹40,000 charge attempt.
She told me it’s from an overseas location.
She mentioned that they’ve flagged it as odd.
I asked what’s next, and she replied calmly.
She said to text your card number and CVV.
She added that the expiry date is needed too.
She warned that delays could cost you more.
She said to do it now—time’s critical!
I told her I’d alert you—she thanked me.
She assured me they’ll block it after.
She asked if you’ve seen other charges.
I said I’d check, and she agreed.
She emphasized that this is urgent.
She instructed me to act fast.
She said it’s a secure process—don’t worry.
She promised safety once you reply.
She urged me to hurry—don’t wait!
She concluded that they’re protecting you.
Text now, she pleaded—let’s fix it!
