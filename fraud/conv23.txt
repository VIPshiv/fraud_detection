Locked! I’m Pooja from your bank.
She said your online access is off.
She told me it’s due to logins.
She mentioned that they’ve blocked it.
I asked what’s next, and she replied.
She said to text your PIN and ID.
She added that your password’s needed.
She warned that it stays off otherwise.
She said to reply in 10 minutes.
I told her I’d warn you—she nodded.
She assured me it’ll unlock after.
She asked if you’ve tried lately.
I said I’d check, and she agreed.
She emphasized that this is urgent.
She instructed me to act now.
She said it’s safe—trust her!
She promised access once you reply.
She urged me to hurry—time’s up!
She concluded that they’re on it.
Text now, she pleaded—get back!
