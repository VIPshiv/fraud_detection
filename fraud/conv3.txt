Good afternoon! I’m Vikram from Microsoft Support.
He called earlier and said your PC has a virus.
He told me it’s stealing data as we speak—scary!
He mentioned that they’ve flagged your device.
I asked how to fix it, and he had a plan.
He said to call their helpline at 555-1234 now.
He explained that they need your admin password.
He added that a ₹8,300 fee activates the repair.
He warned that waiting could crash your system.
I told him I’d relay this to you immediately.
He said it’s urgent—files are at risk!
He assured me their team is ready to help.
He asked if you’ve noticed slow performance lately.
I said I’d check with you, and he nodded.
He emphasized that this is a limited-time fix.
He instructed me to stress the ₹8,300 payment.
He said to act within 30 minutes for safety.
He promised a full recovery once you call.
He concluded that they’re here to save your data.
Don’t delay, he urged—call now!
