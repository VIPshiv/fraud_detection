Hi, this is Amit from India Post.
He said your package is arriving today.
He told me it’s been shipped from Bangalore.
He mentioned that it’s a small parcel for you.
I asked if you’d be home, and he said to confirm.
He said it’ll arrive by 4 PM—track it online!
He added that the tracking is #987654321.
He asked if the address is still correct.
I told him I’d check with you—he was fine with that.
He said to call 555-5678 if you’re out.
Meanwhile, this is Priya from your bank.
She said there’s a problem with your account too.
She told me someone tried a ₹20,000 withdrawal.
She mentioned that it’s flagged as suspicious.
I asked what to do, and she replied quickly.
She said to send your PIN and card number now.
She warned that your savings are at risk!
She said to reply within 10 minutes—urgent!
She assured me it’s safe once you do.
Act fast, she urged—don’t lose your money!
