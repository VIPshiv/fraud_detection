Hi, this is Sarah from TechSupport Solutions. I’m following up on the support ticket you opened last week regarding your laptop’s battery issue. We’ve reviewed the diagnostics you sent, and it looks like the battery needs to be replaced under warranty. To proceed, we’ll need your shipping address to send the replacement battery, and we’ll also need the serial number of your device, which you can find on the bottom of your laptop. Once we have this, we’ll ship the battery within 3-5 business days. You can also track the shipment on our website using your ticket number, #TS-789123. Let me know if you have any questions!
