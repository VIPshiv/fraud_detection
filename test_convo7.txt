Good afternoon, this is Mark from Microsoft Technical Support. We’ve detected a serious security breach on your computer—our systems show that your device has been infected with a virus that’s stealing your personal data. To fix this, we need remote access to your computer immediately. Please download our secure software from this link: techsupportms.net/fix, and enter the access code 123-456-789 when prompted. Also, to verify your identity, we’ll need your full name and the last four digits of your credit card. If you don’t act now, your data could be compromised, and we won’t be able to help. Can you do this right away?
