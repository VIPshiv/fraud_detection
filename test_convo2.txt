Hello, this is Priya from your bank’s fraud prevention team. We’ve noticed some unusual activity on your account—a charge of $1,200 from an overseas vendor. To secure your account, we need you to verify your identity immediately. Please provide your full name, date of birth, and the 16-digit number on your debit card, along with the CVV code on the back. This is urgent, and failure to comply may result in your account being frozen. Also, we’ll need your online banking password to ensure no further unauthorized transactions occur. Can you provide this information now?
