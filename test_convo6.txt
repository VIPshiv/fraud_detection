Hello, my name is Emily, and I’m reaching out on behalf of HopeForAll, a registered non-profit organization. We’re currently running a campaign to provide meals for families affected by the recent floods in the region. We’re looking for donations to help us reach our goal of 10,000 meals by the end of the month. If you’d like to contribute, you can donate any amount via our secure website at hopeforall.org/donate, or I can send you a link to our verified PayPal account. We also accept donations of non-perishable food items if you’d prefer to drop them off at our local center. Thank you for considering this cause!
