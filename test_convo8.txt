Hi, this is Lisa from your insurance provider, SecureLife. I’m calling to update your policy details as part of our annual review. We’ve noticed that your current plan doesn’t include coverage for flood damage, which might be a concern given your location. I can add this coverage for an additional $15 per month—would you like to proceed? To confirm, I’ll need your policy number, which you can find on your statement, and I’ll send a verification code to your registered email for security. Also, while we’re on the call, I wanted to let you know about a special promotion: if you refer a friend, you’ll get a $50 gift card! Just give me their email address, and I’ll send them an invite.
