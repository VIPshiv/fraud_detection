Hi, this is Meera from the dentist.
She said your cleaning’s next week.
She told me it’s Tuesday at 11 AM.
She mentioned that it’s due now.
I asked if it works, and she said yes.
She said to bring your card.
She added that they’ve missed you.
She asked if you’ve had pain.
I told her I’d check—she nodded.
She said to call 555-4567 if off.
She assured me they’re ready.
She warned that it’s busy then.
She said to confirm by Monday.
I told her I’d pass this—she agreed.
She emphasized that it’s routine.
She instructed me to update her.
She said they’ll text too.
She concluded that they’re excited.
She urged me to reply—don’t miss!
See you, she cheered—smile on!
