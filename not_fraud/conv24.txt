Good afternoon! I’m Sonia from warranty.
She said your car plan’s expiring.
She told me it’s up next month.
She mentioned that it’s renewable.
I asked if you’d extend, and she said yes.
She said to call 555-8903 soon.
She added that there’s a deal now.
She asked if you’ve used it.
I told her I’d check—she nodded.
She said to visit warranty.com too.
She assured me it’s still active.
She warned that it lapses soon.
She said to renew by Friday.
I told her I’d relay this—she agreed.
She emphasized that it’s worth it.
She instructed me to confirm.
She said they’ll remind you.
She concluded that they’re here.
She urged me to act—don’t miss!
Covered, she cheered—extend it!
