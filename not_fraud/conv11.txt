Hi, this is Deepak from the vet.
He said Fluffy’s checkup’s Tuesday.
He told me it’s at 3 PM—cute pup!
He mentioned that shots are due.
I asked if it works, and he said yes.
He said to bring her records.
He added that they’ve missed her.
He asked if she’s been well.
I told him I’d check—he smiled.
He said to call 555-2346 if off.
He assured me they’re ready.
He warned that it’s busy then.
He said to confirm by Monday.
I told him I’d pass this—he nodded.
He emphasized that it’s routine.
He instructed me to update him.
He said they’ll text too.
He concluded that they’re excited.
He urged me to reply—don’t miss!
See Fluffy soon, he cheered—woof!
